(** Typed tree construction and validation *)

(** This module focuses on building the Type tree from the parse tree
    and provides a number of validation in doing so.

    Not that the field types are not resolved, and the returned type tree is
    hence of type [unresolved_field_type Pb_typing_type_tree.proto_type].
    The type resolution is done in [Pb_typing_resolution] *)

module Pt = Pb_parsing_parse_tree
module Tt = Pb_typing_type_tree

(** {2 Type tree construction} *)

val validate : Pt.proto -> Pb_field_type.unresolved Tt.proto
(** [validate file_name proto] makes a first phase compilation of the
    parsed tree.  *)

(** {2 Testing Only} *)

val validate_message :
  ?parent_options:Pb_option.set ->
  string ->
  Pb_option.set ->
  (* file options *)
  Tt.type_scope ->
  Pt.message ->
  Pb_field_type.unresolved Tt.proto_type list
