(** Compile protobuf typed tree to the OCaml AST.

    This module focuses on the compilation steps which transforms a
    fully resolved Protobuf message into an OCaml representation.

    After compilation this module also expose code generation
    functionality.  *)

module Ot = Pb_codegen_ocaml_type

(** {2 Compilation } *)

val compile : unsigned_tag:bool -> Pb_field_type.resolved Tt.proto -> Ot.proto

(** Internal helpers.

    For now there are no guarantees of stability within this module.
    It's unlikely that the signatures will change, but the possibility
    is still there.
