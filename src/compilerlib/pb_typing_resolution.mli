(** Type resolution.

    This module resolves all the user defined for the protobuf message
    fields; while built-in types were previously valided in
    [Pb_typing_validation] module.

    After this resolution is complete each user defined field type will
    be a link to a unique message type identify by its id; in other word
    the type graph will is complete.

    If the resolution fails then [Pb_exception.Compilation_error] is
    raised.
