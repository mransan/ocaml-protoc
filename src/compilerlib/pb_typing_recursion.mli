(** Mutually recursive type resolution *)

(** The protobuf syntax allows the definition of mutually recursive
    types, however this declaration is implicit (ie no dedicated syntax
    to group together types which are mutually recursive).

    OCaml requires mutually recursive types to be defined with an explicit
    syntax (using the [and] keyword), therefore it is necessary to
    find all the mutually recursive protobuf types.

    This module performs the recursion analysis using the Tarjan graph
    algorithm to find all the Strongly Connnected Components. *)

module Tt = Pb_typing_type_tree

val group :
  Pb_field_type.resolved Tt.proto_type list ->
  Pb_field_type.resolved Tt.proto_type list list
(** [group types] returns the list of all the mutually recursive group
      of types in reverse order of dependency. In other the last group of
      types of the returned list don't depend on any other types. *)
