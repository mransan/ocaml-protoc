(** [add_service http_server service] adds all handlers of [service]
    to the given httpd.

    As a reminder, a RPC "foo" under service "bar" is routed under [prefix/bar/foo]
    using the POST method.
    The body is either binary, alongside the header "application/protobuf",
    or JSON, alongside the header "application/json".
    Errors are always encoded as a JSON object and are indicated by a
    failing HTTP code (outside of [200â€¦299] range).

    RPCs that use streaming (on either the client or server side)
    will always return "501 unimplemented", because
    twirp over http 1.1 does not support streaming.
